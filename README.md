# 🎨 AI Fashion Fitting Room - Frontend Demo

A fully-functional, hard-coded frontend demonstration of an AI-powered online fitting room application. This project showcases the concept of virtual try-on technology without requiring any backend infrastructure.

## 📋 Project Overview

This application allows users to:
- Upload their photos
- Try on virtual outfits (emoji-based demo overlay)
- Receive AI-style suggestions (simulated)
- Share their looks on social media (demo mode)

Note: The avatar selection UI is currently not exposed in the demo. The code defines 5 avatar types (slim, athletic, average, curvy, plus) but the app currently defaults to the "slim" avatar. See "Developer Tips" below for how to re-enable avatar selection.

### 🎯 Key Features Implemented

#### 📸 1. Image Upload Section
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Click-to-upload functionality
- File type validation (JPEG/PNG only)
- File size validation (5MB max)
- Image preview with remove option
- Real-time validation feedback

#### 🧍 2. Avatar System (default)
- 5 preset avatar body types are defined in the code (slim, athletic, average, curvy, plus)
- The demo currently uses the slim avatar as the default and the avatar-selection UI is not enabled.
- Visual avatar preview happens in the try-on display (emoji-based). To restore a selectable avatar panel, see the Developer Tips section.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No server required - runs entirely in the browser

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files**
   ```bash
   # All files should be in the same directory:
   # - index.html
   # - styles.css
   # - script.js
   ```

2. **Open the application**
   - Simply double-click `index.html`, or
   - Right-click `index.html` → Open with → Your browser
   - Or serve with a local server (optional)

## 📖 Usage Guide

### Step 1: Upload Your Photo
1. Click the upload area or drag-and-drop a photo
2. Supported formats: JPEG, PNG
3. Maximum file size: 5MB
4. View your photo in the preview area

### Step 2: Avatar (current behavior)
1. The demo currently defaults to the slim avatar. There is no dropdown selector in the UI right now.
2. If you want to change the avatar used for preview, edit `script.js` and set `selectedAvatar` to one of: `slim`, `athletic`, `average`, `curvy`, `plus`.
3. To restore a UI selector, see Developer Tips below.

### Step 3: Try On Outfits
1. Browse the 9 available outfits (emoji placeholders)
2. Click any outfit to see it on your avatar
3. The virtual try-on display updates instantly

### Step 4: Get AI Recommendations
1. Click "Match & Rank Outfits" for AI analysis
2. See which outfit is your "Top Pick"
3. Click "Get Style Suggestion" for personalized tips

### Step 5: Share Your Style

### Adding More Outfits
Outfits are defined in `script.js` as a JS object. Edit `script.js`:
```javascript
const outfits = {
  outfit9: { emoji: '👘', name: 'New Outfit' },
    // Add more...
};
```

Then add HTML in `index.html`:
```html
<div class="outfit-card" data-outfit="outfit9">
    <div class="outfit-image">👘</div>
    <div class="outfit-info">
        <h4>New Outfit</h4>
        <p class="price">$XX.XX</p>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Adding AI Suggestions
Edit `script.js`:
```javascript
const aiSuggestions = [
    { icon: '🌟', text: 'Your new suggestion here!' },
    // Add more...
];
```

### Changing Colors
Edit CSS variables in `styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #yourcolor;
    --secondary-color: #yourcolor;
    /* etc. */
}
```

## 🚧 Known Limitations

Since this is a hard-coded demo:
- No actual 3D modeling
- No real AI processing
- Photos aren't actually analyzed
- Social sharing is simulated
- No backend/database
- Outfit overlays are simple emoji representations

Additional known issues (repo-specific):
- The demo defines 9 outfits but older README text referenced 8 — this README has been updated to reflect 9 outfits.
- One outfit in `index.html` (`outfit8`) currently displays a replacement character (�) in some environments — update the emoji in `index.html` or `script.js` to a supported emoji (e.g., `🏃` or `👟`).
- A small JavaScript bug: the hover-effect section references `outfitCards` but the variable defined earlier is `allOutfitCards`. This can cause a console error preventing hover animations; replace `outfitCards` with `allOutfitCards` in `script.js`.
- Avatar selection UI is not currently present (see notes above).

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

For a production version, consider:
- Real 3D body scanning
- Actual AI/ML integration
- Database-driven outfit catalog
- User accounts and profiles
- Real social media integration
- Advanced size mapping algorithms
- WebGL rendering for realistic try-on

Developer tips
- To re-enable avatar selection UI:
  1. Add a select/dropdown in `index.html` (for example a `<select id="avatarSelect">`).
  2. Wire it to update `selectedAvatar` in `script.js` and call `updateTryOnDisplay()` on change.
  3. Optionally use `avatars` object in `script.js` to populate the dropdown programmatically.

- To fix the hover bug mentioned above, open `script.js` and replace the undefined `outfitCards` usage with `allOutfitCards` (the variable used elsewhere).

- To change the default avatar used at startup, edit the `selectedAvatar` variable near the top of `script.js`.
